[v1.0.0](https://github.com/cuiyiming007/sunflowr-by-java/releases/tag/v1.0.0)  | android architecture in Java

## A brief description between v1.1.0 and v1.2.0

In [v1.1.0](https://github.com/cuiyiming007/sunflowr-by-java/releases/tag/v1.1.0), I reference the Google Official Sample [GithubBrowserSample](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/GithubBrowserSample). Re-write the di codes from Kotlin to Java.  
To inject ViewModels, weâ€™ve to create a singleton [factory](https://github.com/cuiyiming007/sunflowr-by-java/blob/6bd49fe8c585e80c62366a6d513945aa9d89712f/app/src/main/java/com/cym/sunflower/viewmodels/ViewModelProviderFactory.java) that was supplied with a map of `ViewModel`-based classes and their respective `Provider`s. It required us to create a custom [`ViewModelKey` annotation](https://github.com/cuiyiming007/sunflowr-by-java/blob/6bd49fe8c585e80c62366a6d513945aa9d89712f/app/src/main/java/com/cym/sunflower/di/ViewModelKey.java) and use Dagger to generate the map in a [module](https://github.com/cuiyiming007/sunflowr-by-java/blob/6bd49fe8c585e80c62366a6d513945aa9d89712f/app/src/main/java/com/cym/sunflower/di/ViewModelModule.java) using `IntoMap` bindings.  
There is the code snippet,  
ViewModelFactory:
```java
@Singleton
public class ViewModelProviderFactory extends ViewModelProvider.NewInstanceFactory {

    Map<Class<? extends ViewModel>, Provider<ViewModel>> creators;

    @Inject
    public ViewModelProviderFactory(Map<Class<? extends ViewModel>, Provider<ViewModel>> creators) {
        this.creators = creators;
    }

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public <T extends ViewModel> T create(@NonNull Class<T> modelClass) {
        Provider<ViewModel> creator = creators.get(modelClass);
        if (creator == null) {
            for (Map.Entry<Class<? extends ViewModel>, Provider<ViewModel>> entry : creators.entrySet()) {
                if (modelClass.isAssignableFrom(entry.getKey())) {
                    creator = entry.getValue();
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        if (creator == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("unknown model class " + modelClass);
        }
        return (T) creator.get();
    }
}
```

ViewModelKey:
```java
@MapKey
@interface ViewModelKey {
    Class<? extends ViewModel> value();
}
```

ViewModelModule:
```java
@Module
abstract class ViewModelModule {
    @Binds
    @IntoMap
    @ViewModelKey(GardenPlantingListViewModel.class)
    abstract ViewModel bindGardenPlantingListViewModel(GardenPlantingListViewModel gardenPlantingListViewModel);

    @Binds
    @IntoMap
    @ViewModelKey(PlantDetailViewModel.class)
    abstract ViewModel bindPlantDetailViewModel(PlantDetailViewModel plantDetailViewModel);

    @Binds
    @IntoMap
    @ViewModelKey(PlantListViewModel.class)
    abstract ViewModel bindPlantListViewModel(PlantListViewModel plantListViewModel);

    @Binds
    abstract ViewModelProvider.Factory bindViewModelFactory(ViewModelProviderFactory factory);
}
```

In [v1.2.0](https://github.com/cuiyiming007/sunflowr-by-java/releases/tag/v1.2.0), we only need to write a generic [`ViewModel factory` class](https://github.com/cuiyiming007/sunflowr-by-java/blob/99d7c5c561b25a350c36b679615bc078132a2f43/app/src/main/java/com/cym/sunflower/viewmodels/ViewModelSimpleFactory.java) of which instances are created for each Activity or [Fragment](https://github.com/cuiyiming007/sunflowr-by-java/blob/99d7c5c561b25a350c36b679615bc078132a2f43/app/src/main/java/com/cym/sunflower/ui/GardenFragment.java) instance.   
There is the code snippet,  
ViewModelFactory:
```java
@Singleton
public class ViewModelSimpleFactory<VM extends ViewModel> extends ViewModelProvider.NewInstanceFactory {

    private Lazy<VM> viewModel;
    @Inject
    public ViewModelSimpleFactory(Lazy<VM> viewModel) {
        this.viewModel = viewModel;
    }

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public <T extends ViewModel> T create(@NonNull Class<T> modelClass) {
        return (T) viewModel.get();
    }
}
```

Activity or Fragment:
```java
public class GardenFragment extends Fragment implements Injectable {
    @Inject
    public ViewModelSimpleFactory<GardenPlantingListViewModel> factory;

    @Override
    public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        //...
        GardenPlantingListViewModel viewModel = ViewModelProviders.of(this, factory).get(GardenPlantingListViewModel.class);
        //...
    }
}
```

That's all!

A gardening app illustrating Android development best practices with Android Jetpack.

Android Sunflower is currently released as an alpha and is under heavy development. To view the
latest changes, please visit the
[Releases page](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-sunflower/releases).
Note that some changes (such as database schema modifications) are not backwards
compatible during this alpha period and may cause the app to crash. In this
case, please uninstall and re-install the app.

Introduction
------------

Android Jetpack is a set of components, tools and guidance to make great Android apps. They bring
together the existing Support Library and Architecture Components and arranges them into four
categories:

![Android Jetpack](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-sunflower/raw/master/screenshots/jetpack_donut.png "Android Jetpack Components")

Android Sunflower demonstrates utilizing these components to create a simple gardening app.
Read the
[Introducing Android Sunflower](https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/introducing-android-sunflower-e421b43fe0c2)
article for a walkthrough of the app.

Getting Started
---------------
This project uses the Gradle build system. To build this project, use the
`gradlew build` command or use "Import Project" in Android Studio.

There are two Gradle tasks for testing the project:
* `connectedAndroidTest` - for running Espresso on a connected device
* `test` - for running unit tests

Upcoming features
-----------------
Updates will include incorporating additional Jetpack components and updating existing components
as the component libraries evolve.

Interested in seeing a particular feature of the Android Framework or Jetpack implemented in this
app? Please open a new [issue](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-sunflower/issues).

Android Studio IDE setup
------------------------
For development, the latest version of Android Studio is required. The latest version can be
downloaded from [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/).

Sunflower uses [ktlint](https://ktlint.github.io/) to enforce Kotlin coding styles.
Here's how to configure it for use with Android Studio (instructions adapted
from the ktlint [README](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/blob/master/README.md)):

- Close Android Studio if it's open

- Download ktlint using these [installation instructions](https://github.com/shyiko/ktlint/blob/master/README.md#installation)

- Inside the project root directory run:

  `./ktlint --apply-to-idea-project --android`

- Start Android Studio

Non-Goals
---------
The focus of this project is on Android Jetpack and the Android framework.
Thus, there are no immediate plans to implement features outside of this scope.

A note on dependency injection - while many projects (such as
[Plaid](https://github.com/nickbutcher/plaid)) use
[Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger) for DI, there are no plans to
incorporate DI into Sunflower.  This allows developers unfamiliar with dependency
injection to better understand Sunflower's code without having to learn DI.
